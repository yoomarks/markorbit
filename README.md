# MarkOrbit

MarkOrbit is the new product monorepo for:

- **MarkOrbit Lite** — the professional growth and work product for trademark practitioners;
- **markreg.com** — the direct-customer international trademark filing and lifecycle product;
- independent **Core**, **Knowledge**, **Capability Engine**, **Execution**, **MarkReg**, and **MGSN** services.

This repository is intentionally new. Previous repositories are reference material only and are not runtime dependencies unless a later migration task explicitly admits selected code.

## MVP objective

Deliver a Beta in four weeks that proves three complete loops:

1. trademark or knowledge → content → reviewed publish package;
2. trademark data → opportunity → qualified intake → matter;
3. direct or professional intake → recommendation → order/matter → provider return → evidence → outcome/reflection.

## Current milestone

**Milestone 5 engineering scope is complete with an independent GO recommendation. Milestone 6 scope planning is proposed.**

M5-WP-08 merged in PR #70 as `242b34f806711df608a7178b238104289e65bb00`. The completed governed application/lifecycle path is:

```text
current governed Execution source
-> durable MGSN Service Package
-> deterministic Eligibility
-> explicit Allocation
-> authenticated Provider Acceptance
-> durable Provider Return
-> exact Execution evidence handoff
-> durable PENDING_REVIEW evidence receipt
-> explicit authorized Evidence Review Decision
-> correction OR exact Reviewed Source Admission
-> retry-safe Execution-to-MarkReg handoff
-> durable MarkReg Lifecycle Projection
-> explainable non-executing Recommended Action
-> authenticated customer / operations projection
```

The M5 authority locks remain permanent: Evidence Review Decision is not Official Truth; reviewed-source admission is not Filing Submission; Lifecycle Projection is not Official Status; Recommended Action does not authorize execution; no Payment/Invoice, legal appointment, automatic Matter completion, automatic Capability verification or cross-service SQL follows from the lifecycle path.

### Proposed Milestone 6 — Durable Capability Learning and Private Reflection

TASK 031A proposes `DURABLE_CAPABILITY_LEARNING_AND_PRIVATE_REFLECTION` as the next MVP direction. M5 explicitly deferred Capability learning until reviewed governed outcomes existed; that prerequisite is now complete.

The proposed M6 loop is:

```text
accepted Capability Canon version
-> durable runtime Capability definition/version
-> exact governed work observation
-> private append-oriented Capability Ledger
-> explainable private Reflection Candidate
-> explicit subject-user ACCEPTED | REJECTED | DEFERRED disposition
-> deterministic private Capability Profile / Twin projection
-> authenticated Lite Capability Center
```

The proposal preserves the repository's Capability authority locks:

- Reflection Candidate is not canonical truth;
- accepted private reflection is not verified professional Capability;
- Provider Supply Capability is not user Capability evidence;
- raw Provider Return is not direct user Capability evidence;
- task completion does not automatically verify Capability;
- AI may draft reflection but may not accept it, verify Capability, mutate Canon or change permissions;
- Capability Twin is a private read model, not an autonomous identity or protected-action authority;
- no public rating/ranking, certification, Payment/Invoice, legal appointment, external filing or Official Truth is introduced.

TASK 031A is planning-only. No M6 runtime implementation, migration, Gateway route or Lite Capability UI change is authorized until the planning PR is merged. After approval, the next implementation step is `M6-WP-01` — Capability learning contracts and canonical authority boundary.
